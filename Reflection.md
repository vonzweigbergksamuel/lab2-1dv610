### Naming

| Names                                     | Reflection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **ShoppingCart**: class name              | **Noun naming**: The class name ShoppingCart complies with the clean code standard that class names should be nouns and not verbs. **Avoid Disinformation**: The class name ShoppingCart tells the user that it holds code for a shopping cart and nothing else. There can be no mixed meanings in that name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **getProductQuantity**: method name       | **Intention-Revealing Names**: It is clear what the method does. It returns the quantity of a product. **Verb naming**: The method name is a verb because it indicates an action by getting something. In this example it gets the quantity of a product.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **getTotalQuantity**: method name         | **Verb naming**: This method name is also a verb because it indicates action. **Make Meaningful Distinctions**: This method makes a meaningful distinction between the previous one. It is clear that this method gets the quantity of the total number of products and that the previous method gets the quantity of a single product. The naming is similar but a distinction is made between the two.                                                                                                                       |
| **addProductToCart**: method name         | **Don't Be Cute**: The name is not clever, ironic or cute which could lead to confusion. The name is aligned with it's purpose. **Avoid Disinformation**: The name technically conveys that it adds items to the cart, but the ToCart suffix is redundant. Since the class is already ShoppingCart, the additional context could mislead someone into thinking there may be another target besides the cart. The disinformation is subtle but still present. The method name could be improved by renaming it to `addProduct`. |
| **incrementProductQuantity**: method name | **Pronounceable Names**: The name is mostly pronounceable but could maybe be improved to `increaseProductQuantity`, making it more pronounceable and familiar to a wider audience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Naming Reflection**: I think the naming is mostly good. I have a habit of making my method names a bit long, while not necessarily making them more descriptive. For example the `addProductToCart` method could be shortened to `addProduct` without losing any meaning. I think I could improve on this by making my method names shorter and more concise. When starting up a new project I sometimes make the mistake of using different names for the same thing. I don't pick one word per concept and stick with it. This can lead to confusion for both myself and others. I am better of fixing this as the project goes on and I refactor my code but in the beginning I could be more consistent to make refactoring easier later on. Outside of those points I think I adhere to the clean code standards for naming. I use verbs for methods and nouns for classes and variables. I try to make my names as descriptive as possible and I avoid disinformation in my names. I don't try to be clever or cute with my names and I try to make meaningful distinctions between similar names.

| **sanitizeData**             | 24   | **Small!**: The method is not as small as the clean code standard suggests. It could be broken down into smaller methods but in my opinion it is still small enough to be easily understood. I think the method could be improved by breaking out the conditional checking if the productId and quantity are numbers and in what intervals to another method though. Overall I think the guideline of small methods is reasonable but I don't think it should be followed blindly. If a method is small enough to be easily understood and doesn't contain too many nested loops or if statements I think it is fine to keep it as is. I think to much nesting is a larger problem than the size of the method. To always have to break down a method into such small methods no matter what leads to unnecessary abstraction which can make the code harder to understand. |
| **decrementProductQuantity** | 11   | **Do One Thing**: The method does one thing, it decrements the quantity of a product. You could argue that it does two things, it decrements the quantity and then checks if the quantity is less than 1. This is a necessary check to make sure that the product is removed from the cart if the quantity is less than 1. It would not make sense to have a product with a quantity of 0 in the cart. I think this is a good example of a method that does one thing but has a necessary check at the end. The remove product functionality is already abstracted into another method so the decrement method doesn't have to worry about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **removeProductFromCart**    | 9    | **Prefer Exceptions**: The method does not throw an exception if the product is not in the cart. It instead logs an error message to the console. Because the scenario where the error log is called is not a breaking error I don't want to throw an exception that would stop the program. My reason for the error log is just to inform that the product was not found in the cart. **Command Query Separation**: The method does not return anything. It only removes the product from the cart. I think this is a good example of command query separation. The method does not return anything, it only changes the state of the cart.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **incrementProductQuantity** | 7    | **Don't Repeat Yourself**: The method does not repeat itself. Because the findItem method is used in multiple places I have abstracted it into a separate method. This way I don't have to repeat the code to find the item in the cart. The addProductToCart and save functionality is also abstracted into separate methods to avoid breaking the DRY principle. **Side Effects**: The method does have side effects. It It changes the state of the cart by incrementing the quantity of a product. It also saves the cart to local- or session storage. These are necessary side effects because the method is supposed to increment the quantity of a product and it is supposed to be saved to the cart.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **addProductToCart**         | 7    | **Function Arguments**: The method has one argument (monadic) which is the productId. The clean code standard suggests that a method should have zero or one arguments. I think this is a good example of a method that has one argument. The method is supposed to add a product to the cart and the only thing it needs to do that is the productId. The method is not too complex and doesn't need more arguments. **Descriptive Name**: The method could be shorter and still convey the same meaning. The ToCart suffix is redundant because the class is already ShoppingCart. The method could be renamed to `addProduct` without losing any meaning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Functions Reflection**: I think my functions are mostly good in terms of adhering to the clean code standards. I try to make my functions do one thing and I try to avoid repeating myself. I think I could improve on the size of my functions. I tend to make my functions a bit longer than the clean code standard suggests. I think this is because I like to have all the code for a specific functionality in one place. I think this is a good practice but I could improve on breaking down the functionality into smaller methods. I try to not have too many arguments in my methods to make them easier to understand and I try to make my method names as descriptive as possible. I think I could improve on this by making my method names shorter and more concise. I also think I could improve on my error handling by throwing exceptions in places with errors that are more severe. My thought process when logging errors instead of throwing exceptions is that I don't want to stop the program from running.

## Reflection

I think a lot of what Robert conveys in his book Clean Code is good advice. For instance the naming conventions are very important. If you have good names for your classes, methods and variables it is much easier to understand what the code does. I think the most important thing is to make your code as readable as possible. If you can read the code and understand what it does you can also understand how to change it. The advice of class names being nouns and variables verbs is very basic but very beneficial to understanding the code. I think the advice of making your methods do one thing is also very good. If you have a method that does multiple things it is harder to understand what the method does. If you have a method that does one thing it is easier to understand what the method does. I have always tried to think about these things when writing code but I think the book has made me more aware of them and given me more guidelines to follow. I think the book has made me more aware of the importance of writing clean code and I will try to follow the guidelines in the book more closely in the future.

When it comes to naming I also agree with principles around using pronounceable names, making meaningfull distinctions, avoiding disinformation, using intention-revealing names, picking one word per concept and not being funny or cute with your naming. All these points that Robert makes are very reasonable and I think they are good guidelines to follow when naming your classes, methods and variables. I think the most important one for me to think about more in the future is the one about picking one word per concept. I often use different names for the same thing early on in my project. This is often confusing, even for me being the one that wrote the code, and creates more work when refactoring or when someone else has to read the code. This was particularly hard for me in projects from last year, for example in the project course. When it comes to using nouns and verbs it wasn't something I really though about before. When looking back I almost always used nouns for classes and attributes and verbs for methods but I wasn't conciously thinking about it. I think this is a good guideline to follow and I will try to be more concious about it in the future.

When it comes to functions I agree with some of the principles and somewhat agree with others. I think the principle of functions doing one thing is generally good, as long as the definition of "one thing" isn't carved in stone. Functions doing one thing is generally easier to understand, maintain, reuse and test but real-world complex task might require a function to do more than one thing, for example handle multiple steps of a coupled process. What I take away is that code should be organized logically and that functions are cohesive and on the smaller side. I don't fully agree with the authors view on the exact size of functions, as in that they shouldn't be larger than 4 lines. I think that an overly strict rule on how large or small a function is allowed to be can easily lead to unnecessary abstraction and confusion. If some part of the function doesn't benefit from being abstracted so it can be used elsewhere (to not overly repeat myself) I don't see much of a point in doing so. A train of thought is easier to hold when looking at a resonable sized and cohesive function rather than only seeing other method calls and having to go find these other methods one by one and having to remember what each one does to get a grip of what the original function is actually doing. If you just use the clean code principle of making your functions small to make them easier to read and understand I think it can be very beneficial, but when you start to take it to the extreme I think it can be more harmful than good.

I mostly agree with the part about keeping the amount of arguments of a function on the smaller side. Less arguments makes it a bit easier to follow and understand, and most certainly easier to test. In some cases three or more arguments might be necessary though and thus shouldn't be completely overlooked. But all and all I think the principle of keeping the amount of arguments to a minimum is a good one. One thing I though was a little confusing though was that the author said that a perfect function doesn't have any arguments, but on the other hand he also said that a function should have side effects. How is it possible to have no side effects and also have no arguments? Isn't this a bit contradictory? I think the author could have been a bit more clear on this point. When it comes to the side effects part I think that it is necessary to have side effects in some functions. All functions can't be pure that only return the same output for the same input. You can't have a functioning program without functions that are able to modify external resources or variables. For example; make calls to a database, interact with DOM elements, increment a global variable/attribute. I think minimizing side effects is a good principle to follow but I don't think it is possible to have no side effects at all. Keep side effects to a minimum but sometimes they are reasonable and necessary.

When it comes to Don't Repeat Yourself I think it is good to have in the back of your mind, but I don't think you should be afraid to repeat yourself sometimes. If you have a small piece of code that is only used in one or two places I think it is fine to repeat it. If you have a larger piece of code that is used in multiple places or you think will be used in multiple other places, I think it is better to abstract it into a separate method. To never be allowed to repeat yourself can be inefficient and can force you to unnecessary abstractions which in turn can make it harder to modify down the line, and so you might be forced into a more complex program just to adhere to the rule of never repeating yourself. To clarify, I think you should aim to not repeat yourself but sometimes it is better to repeat yourself than to make the code more complex than it needs to be. I don't agree with the author that the duplication of code is the root of all evil in software. I think that statement is a bit too extreme. DRY can be good but it's not the be all and end all of good software development.

To end my thoughts about what I have learned from the book I think that using Descriptive Names and Command Query Separation are really solid principles. All in all I have gotten a lot from the first chapters of the book, both new principles and improved on old ones to better my coding, and some topics that I don't necessarily one hundred percent agree with but has made me think more about my own coding practices.
